A portfolio to showcase my background and experience with web development.

1. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official website if you haven't already: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/)

3. Once Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies listed in your `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:


   ```bash
   npm install


5. This will start a local development server, and your website should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser. You can view and interact with your website locally while making changes to the code.

6. As you make changes to your code, the development server should automatically reload and reflect those changes in your browser.

That's it! You should now have your website running locally for development purposes.
